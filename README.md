Multi-task learning enables the acquisition of task-generic knowledge by training
multiple tasks within a unified architecture. However, training all tasks together
in a single architecture can lead to performance degradation, known as negative
transfer, which is a main concern in multi-task learning. Previous works have
addressed this issue by optimizing the multi-task network through gradient manipulation or weighted loss adjustments. However, their optimization strategy
focuses on addressing task imbalance in shared parameters, neglecting the learning of task-specific parameters. As a result, they show limitations in mitigating
negative transfer, since the learning of shared space and task-specific information
influences each other during optimization. To address this, we propose a different
approach to enhance multi-task performance by selectively grouping tasks and
updating them for each batch during optimization. We introduce an algorithm that
adaptively determines how to effectively group tasks and update them during the
learning process. To track inter-task relations and optimize multi-task networks
simultaneously, we propose proximal inter-task affinity, which can be measured
during the optimization process. We provide a theoretical analysis on how dividing
tasks into multiple groups and updating them sequentially significantly affects
multi-task performance by enhancing the learning of task-specific parameters. Our
methods substantially outperform previous multi-task optimization approaches and
are scalable to different architectures and various numbers of tasks.
